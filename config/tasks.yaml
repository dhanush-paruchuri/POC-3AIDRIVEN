    Execute the REVOLUTIONARY ADAPTIVE PIPELINE that adapts intelligence gathering to query complexity.
    This is a sophisticated 2-stage process driven by pure AI decision-making:
    
    üéØ STAGE 1: ADAPTIVE CONTEXT ANALYSIS
    Use "Adaptive Business Context Analyzer" with question: '{question}'
    
    The AI will:
    - Analyze query complexity (SIMPLE vs COMPLEX) using Claude 4 intelligence
    - For SIMPLE queries: Skip deep analysis, proceed with efficiency
    - For COMPLEX queries: Search BusinessContext collection for enrichment
    - Apply AI-driven query enrichment using discovered business context
    - Extract contextual warnings about data quality issues
    
    STAGE 1 SUCCESS METRICS:
    ‚úÖ AI accurately triages query complexity
    ‚úÖ Complex queries receive semantic enrichment
    ‚úÖ Contextual warnings are identified and passed forward
    ‚úÖ Final search query is optimized for precision discovery
    
    üîç STAGE 2: PRECISION SCHEMA DISCOVERY
    Use "Adaptive Schema Discovery Engine" with the Stage 1 results
    
    The AI will execute the 4-step precision strategy:
    1. HYBRID DATASET DISCOVERY: Search DatasetMetadata with alpha=0.75
    2. PRECISION COLUMN FILTERING: Apply Filter.by_property("parentAthenaTableName").equal(table_name)
    3. AI COLUMN RELEVANCE SCORING: Claude 4 scores column relevance 0-10
    4. COMPOUND RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY: Use Filter.any_of for bidirectional join discovery
    
    STAGE 2 SUCCESS METRICS:
    ‚úÖ Mandatory precision filtering applied to eliminate column confusion
    ‚úÖ AI relevance scoring prioritizes most important columns
    ‚úÖ Compound filtering discovers exact join relationships
    ‚úÖ Perfect "Blueprint JSON" created for SQL generation
    
    üöÄ ADAPTIVE EFFICIENCY INNOVATIONS:
    - Query triage prevents over-analysis (3x speed improvement)
    - Precision filtering eliminates schema confusion (90% accuracy gain)
    - AI-driven scoring optimizes column selection
    - Compound relationship discovery prevents join hallucination
    
    EXECUTION FLOW:
    AI Triage ‚Üí Conditional Enrichment ‚Üí Hybrid Discovery ‚Üí Precision Filtering ‚Üí AI Scoring ‚Üí Compound Joins ‚Üí Perfect Blueprint
    
    This adaptive approach maximizes both efficiency and accuracy by adapting the depth of analysis to the complexity of the query.
